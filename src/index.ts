/**
 *
 * Introducing a DOM tree structure with reactivity powered by RxJS.
 *
 * Key features of this library include:
 * *  **Compact Size**: The compressed bundle size is under 4kB.
 * *  **Simple & Consistent API**: With just one function, one class, and about 20 type aliases,
 * the API is both straightforward and uniform.
 * *  **Type Safety**: At its core, **@youwol/rx-vdom** relies on the strongly-typed {@link VirtualDOM} structure.
 * It offers robust type checking and inline guidance within TypeScript environment.
 *
 * To get started, please refer to the {@link VirtualDOM | VirtualDOM documentation}.
