# @youwol/rx-vdom

Introducing a declarative and reactive DOM tree structure.

Key features of the library include:

- **Compact Size & Dependency-Free:** The compressed bundle size is less than 4kB. Reactivity,
  usually with [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), is opt-in by the consumer.
- **Simple & Consistent API:** The API is minimal, building directly on standard HTML and reactive programming
  principles.
- **Type Safety:** Supported by the strongly-typed [VirtualDOM](@nav/api/api.VirtualDOM) structure,
  it provides robust type checking and inline guidance within a TypeScript environment.

For an introduction to the concepts, please refer to the [tutorial](@nav/tutorials/basics) section.
